This git repository containts an implementation of a simple task manager RESTful API.
The flow of the system is as follows:
Upon receiving an http request, for example - 
curl localhost:9000/api/people 
the input wil first be received via our conf/routes, which will then give pass control to our controller 
app/controllers/ToDoListController to the relevant function, according to the input url from the request,
and will also pass on any additional data and paramters provided in the request.
The controller will apply the relevant logic using the input provided, and will return a relevant
HTTP code, and possibly additional data, back to the the sender of the request.
